Unit 4 Homework: Pandas, Pandas, Pandas
In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyse school and standardised test data.

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name the folder PyCitySchools.


Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.



Background
Having spent years analysing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. Your latest role is Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
Hint: Check out a sample solution to review the desired format for this assignment.

Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
Create a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the area's key metrics, including the following:

Total schools
Total students
Total budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


School Summary
Create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school, including the following:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Create a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


Maths Scores by Year
Create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Reading Scores by Year
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)


Scores by School Size
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (government or independent).
